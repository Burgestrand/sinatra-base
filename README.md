# Sinatra Base

Playing with Sinatra from time to time, I tend to do the setup in the same way.

- Development console with pry, started with `rake console`.
- Asset pipeline with sprockets, with compass support.
- Serenade.js registered with sprockets and support for serenade views.
- LiveReload in development, using Guard and rack-livereload.
